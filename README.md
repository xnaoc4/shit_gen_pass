This is a Python program that generates passwords. Technically, these passwords are perfectly acceptable, but in practice they are probably useless to most people. 
It might be useful to someone, but not to everyone (probably the paranoids).

You'll look at my previous repos and think about it. 
Why did you write it in Python? 
Well, when you want to hammer a nail, you take a hammer and hammer the nail, but you don't go into the woods to find a tree, and then make a handle for the hammer and so on, well, you understand the logic.
